            Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca 
            citadel located in the Eastern 
            Cordillera of southern Peru on a 
            2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain 
            ridge. Often referred to as the 
            "Lost City of the Incas", 
            it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire.  
            It is located in the Machupicchu District within 
            Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, 
            which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco.
            <br>
            The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting 
            through the Cordillera and creating a 
            canyon with a tropical mountain climate. 
            In reference to the site's name, for most 
            English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' 
            in Picchu is silent. 
            Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian 
            Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a 
            UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. 
            In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one 
            of the New Seven Wonders of the 
            World in a worldwide internet poll.
