                    About Alexander Hamilton
                </h1>
                <p>
                    ➽ Alexander Hamilton, was born on January 11, 1755,
                    in wedlock in Charlestown, Nevis. He pursued his 
                    education in New York City where, despite his young age, 
                    he was a prolific and widely read pamphleteer advocating 
                    for the American revolutionary cause, though an anonymous one.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ He served as the first Secretary of Treasury 
                    from 1789 to 1795 during George Washington's presidency.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ As a trusted member of President Washington's first cabinet, 
                    Hamilton served as the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. 
                    He envisioned a central government led by an energetic 
                    president, a strong national defense, and an industrial economy.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ While on Washington's staff, Hamilton long sought command and a 
                    return to active combat. As the war drew nearer to an end, 
                    he knew that opportunities for military glory were diminishing.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ While on Washington's staff, Hamilton long sought command and a 
                    return to active combat. As the war drew nearer to an end, 
                    he knew that opportunities for military glory were diminishing.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ On July 31, Washington relented and assigned Hamilton as 
                    commander of a battalion of light infantry companies of the 1st 
                    and 2nd New York Regiments and two provisional companies from Connecticut.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ After Yorktown, Hamilton returned to New York City and resigned 
                    his commission in March 1782. He passed the bar in July after six 
                    months of self-directed education and, in October, was licensed 
                    to argue cases before the Supreme Court of New York.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented soldiers began 
                    to pose a danger to the young United States. Most of the 
                    army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the 
                    army were funding much of their own supplies, and they had 
                    not been paid in eight months.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ In June 1783, a different group of disgruntled soldiers from 
                    Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent Congress a petition demanding 
                    their back pay. When they began to march toward Philadelphia, 
                    Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ Hamilton resigned from Congress in 1783. When the British 
                    left New York in 1783, he practiced there in partnership with 
                    Richard Harison. He specialized in defending Tories and 
                    British subjects, as in Rutgers v. Waddington, in which he 
                    defeated a claim for damages done to a brewery by the Englishmen 
                    who held it during the military occupation of New York.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ In 1787, Hamilton served as assemblyman from New York County 
                    in the New York State Legislature and was chosen as a 
                    delegate at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia 
                    by his father-in-law Philip Schuyler.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ Hamilton recruited John Jay and James Madison to 
                    write The Federalist Papers, a series of essays, 
                    to defend the proposed Constitution.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ Before the adjournment of the House in September 1789, 
                    they requested Hamilton to make a report on suggestions 
                    to improve the public credit by January 1790.
                    <br><br>
                    ➽ The duel began at dawn on July 11, 1804, 
                    along the west bank of the Hudson River on a rocky 
                    ledge in Weehawken, New Jersey.
